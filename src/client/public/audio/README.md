# Audio Assets

Add audio files for the game here:

- `background-music.mp3` - Looped background music for the game
- `hit.mp3` - Sound effect for correct guess
- `wrong.mp3` - Sound effect for incorrect guess (or general error)

These will be registered in the AudioManager during game initialization.

**Note:** For quick testing, you can use free CC0 license audio from:
- Freepd.com
- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat.com

Or use data URIs/web audio API to generate simple beeps during development.
